# Team-Profile-Generator
Description: This repo uses node.js packages (mainly Inquirer) to make a dynamically-created html file that contains team information.

Installation: N/A

Usage: Upon initiation of node.js and installation of the inquirer package, the user can run index.js in the command line to get a series of prompts. The user then answers each prompt and, upon finishing, an html file entitled "generated-html" is created, which can be opened and should display the team that was generated through answering the provided prompts.
